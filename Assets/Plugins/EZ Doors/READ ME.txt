//EZ DOORS// v1.2
If you have any questions contact me at http://deepnitegames.com, email deepnitegames@gmail.com, or tweet @deepnitegames or @dirt410 on Twitter

!!I have removed dependencies for probuilder/progrids/render pipeline stuff, which seem to have been the bulk of issues for people. Sorry I didn't do this sooner.!!

Tutorials are available on my Youtube Channel @ https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCNEiT3Ts8Omj4RuUkS6gJ0g

//SETUP//

!!If you are using URP or HDRP Render Pipelines, make sure to upgrade materials via 
		Edit > Render Pipeline > [URP/HDRP] Render Pipeline > Upgrade Project Materials...!!

NOTE: Install Text Mesh Pro from Package Manager if not already installed.

//AUTO-CREATION// (New to v1.2)

1. You can create doors automatically with standard dimensions either by using the GAMEOBJECT menu, hovering over EZ DOOR sub-menu and 
----selecting Standard Rotating Door, Standard Sliding Door, or creating a custom door.

OR

2. By right-clicking in the hierarchy window and hovering over EZ DOOR and selecting the door type from there.

You can also customize the SPAWN POSITION, DOOR OFFSET, and DOOR SCALE using the CREATE CUSTOM DOOR editor window.

Found in GAMEOBJECT > EZ DOOR > CREATE CUSTOM DOOR

Either of these 'auto-creation' options will create a new GameObject with the corresponding component attached with a primitive cube as the child.
The cube is only meant as a temporary mesh which you can easily replace with your own model. 

NOTE: If the origin of your custom model is not centered you will have to adjust the model's local position to line up with the origin of the parent object.

//MANUAL CREATION//

1. Create Empty GameObject
2. Reset GO position to world origin (0,0,0)
3. Set GO y-position to half the height of the intended door
	EXAMPLE: If the door height is 3, set y-position to 1.5
4. Add Rotating / Sliding Door component
5. Size Box Collider to size of the door, equal to the door mesh dimensions and center to door mesh
6. Add door mesh as child or create your own door mesh (no collider is needed on mesh)

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

//INTERACTION//

Add 'DoorInteract.cs' to the player GameObject.
OR
Implement IInteractable interface in player-based script. See 'PlayerInteraction.cs' or 'DoorInteract.cs' for examples.

NOTE: Remember to add the appropriate using statements to the top of any scripts you create.
